      <p>Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White (Bryan Cranston),
        a chemistry teacher who lives in New Mexico with his wife (Anna Gunn) 
        and teenage son (RJ Mitte) who has cerebral palsy. 
        White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live.
        With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial security, 
        White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in the world. 
        The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints 
        of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.</p>
